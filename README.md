# admin_panel_sniffer
A powerful admin login page finder in python.. Should work with both python 2 and 3.

# Use:
python admin_sniffer.py domain strict save visible wordlist

domain is obvious.

strict: whether or not you care about 403 and 401 responses

visible: whether or not you want the script to show each link as it's being tested

PS: written for pure testing
